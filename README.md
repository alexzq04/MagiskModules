1. Start by installing the latest version of Magisk on your rooted phone.
2. Then go to "Modules", "Install from storage" and select "ThermalPX.zip".
3. When the installation finishes, reboot your phone and the magisk module should be installed.  


## Which devices are compatible?
This Module was tested on a POCO X3 PRO and it works flawlessly, but it should work on most of POCO/XIAOMI devices.
