# Thermal PX
**Thermal PX** is a Magisk Module used to remove Android Thermal Throttling completely.

## How does it work?
It is a Magisk Module that goes to */system/vendor/etc* and */system/vendor/bin* to empty some files that make our device slower when high temperatures are reached.

## Which devices are compatible?
This Magisk Module was tested on a POCO X3 PRO and it works flawlessly, but it should work on most of POCO/XIAOMI devices.
