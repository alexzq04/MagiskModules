# Thermal PX
**Thermal PX** is a Magisk Module used to remove Android Thermal Throttling completely.


## How does it work?
It is a Magisk Module that goes to */system/vendor/etc* and */system/vendor/bin* to empty some files that make our device slower when high temperatures are reached.


## How can I start using it?
1. Start by installing the latest version of Magisk on your rooted phone.
2. Then go to "Modules", "Install from storage" and select "ThermalPX.zip".
3. When the installation finishes, reboot your phone and the magisk module should be installed.  


## Which devices are compatible?
This Module was tested on a POCO X3 PRO and it works flawlessly, but it should work on most of POCO/XIAOMI devices.
